Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear VINAY ANDERSON,

I am writing to you from a DAZZLING spaceship in a VAST galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a PINK rocket in NOVEMBER. There are 79 cars and friends of Dog here! In the
Game room there is a pool full of water. I fall asleep each night on a uncomfortable bed of
Latex and dream of running slowly. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
